# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for migrating ePDFView from GTK2/Make to GTK4/Meson build system. The project is currently halfway through this migration and needs to be completed to modernize the codebase, improve maintainability, and ensure compatibility with current Linux distributions.

## Glossary

- **ePDFView**: The lightweight PDF viewer application being migrated
- **GTK2**: Legacy version of the GIMP Toolkit (deprecated)
- **GTK4**: Current version of the GIMP Toolkit with modern APIs
- **Make/Autotools**: Legacy build system using configure.ac and Makefile.am
- **Meson**: Modern build system with meson.build files
- **Migration_System**: The combined effort to update both UI toolkit and build system
- **Compatibility_Layer**: Code that bridges GTK2/GTK4 API differences

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to complete the GTK4 migration, so that the application uses modern UI APIs and remains compatible with current Linux distributions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application, THE Migration_System SHALL use only GTK4 APIs without GTK2 dependencies
2. WHEN the application runs, THE Migration_System SHALL display all UI elements correctly using GTK4 widgets
3. WHEN users interact with the interface, THE Migration_System SHALL respond to events using GTK4 event handling
4. WHERE GTK4 API changes exist, THE Migration_System SHALL implement proper replacements for deprecated GTK2 functions
5. WHILE maintaining functionality, THE Migration_System SHALL remove all GTK2 compatibility code from GTK4Compat.h

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to complete the Meson build system migration, so that the project uses modern build tools and simplifies the build process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the build, THE Migration_System SHALL use only Meson build files without Autotools dependencies
2. WHEN building the application, THE Migration_System SHALL compile successfully using ninja build commands
3. WHEN installing the application, THE Migration_System SHALL install all components correctly via Meson install
4. WHERE build options exist, THE Migration_System SHALL support debug/release configurations through Meson options
5. WHILE preserving functionality, THE Migration_System SHALL remove all Autotools files (configure.ac, Makefile.am, etc.)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all application features work correctly after migration, so that users experience no loss of functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening PDF files, THE Migration_System SHALL display documents with the same quality as the original version
2. WHEN using zoom controls, THE Migration_System SHALL provide all zoom modes (fit, width, custom) correctly
3. WHEN searching text, THE Migration_System SHALL find and highlight text matches as before
4. WHERE printing is available, THE Migration_System SHALL maintain CUPS printing functionality on supported platforms
5. WHILE navigating documents, THE Migration_System SHALL preserve all keyboard shortcuts and menu actions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want clean, modern code without legacy compatibility layers, so that the codebase is easier to maintain and extend.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing source code, THE Migration_System SHALL contain no GTK2-specific code or includes
2. WHEN examining build files, THE Migration_System SHALL contain no Autotools configuration files
3. WHEN checking dependencies, THE Migration_System SHALL require only GTK4 and modern library versions
4. WHERE compatibility code exists, THE Migration_System SHALL remove temporary migration helpers
5. WHILE updating code, THE Migration_System SHALL follow consistent C++11 coding standards throughout

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the migrated application to install and run on modern Linux distributions, so that I can continue using ePDFView with current systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing on current distributions, THE Migration_System SHALL install without dependency conflicts
2. WHEN launching the application, THE Migration_System SHALL start correctly on Wayland and X11 display servers
3. WHEN using system themes, THE Migration_System SHALL respect GTK4 theming and dark mode preferences
4. WHERE desktop integration exists, THE Migration_System SHALL register proper MIME types and desktop entries
5. WHILE maintaining compatibility, THE Migration_System SHALL work with current versions of Poppler library
