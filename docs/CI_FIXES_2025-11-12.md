# GitHub Issue: FreeBSD CI Build Failure - Bash Dependency

## Issue Description

FreeBSD CI builds were failing with:
```
Error: The process '/usr/bin/bash' failed with exit code 1
```

## Root Cause

The GitHub Actions workflow had `usesh: true` in the FreeBSD VM configuration:

```yaml
build-freebsd:
  name: Build on FreeBSD
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: vmactions/freebsd-vm@v1
    with:
      usesh: true  # ← THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
      prepare: |
        pkg install -y meson ninja gtk4 poppler-glib cups gettext-tools
```

**Why it failed:**
- `usesh: true` forces the use of `/usr/bin/bash`
- FreeBSD does not include bash by default
- The default shell is `/bin/sh` (POSIX shell) or `/bin/tcsh`
- The action tried to execute `/usr/bin/bash` which doesn't exist

## Solution

Removed `usesh: true` from the workflow configuration:

```yaml
build-freebsd:
  name: Build on FreeBSD
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  steps:
  - uses: vmactions/freebsd-vm@v1
    with:
      # Use default FreeBSD shell (sh/tcsh) instead of bash
      # usesh: true causes "bash: not found" errors
      prepare: |
        pkg install -y meson ninja gtk4 poppler-glib cups gettext-tools
      run: |
        meson setup builddir --buildtype=release
        meson compile -C builddir
```

This allows the action to use FreeBSD's default shell, which is always available.

## Additional Improvements

While fixing this issue, we also:

1. **Added Windows CI Build:**
   - Uses MSYS2 environment
   - Builds with MinGW-w64
   - Automated testing on Windows platform

2. **Updated Documentation:**
   - `README` now reflects C++14 standard and platform support
   - `PROJECT_STATUS.md` updated with recent fixes
   - Created `STATUS.md` for quick status overview
   - Moved `CURRENT_STATUS.md` to `docs/` to reduce root directory clutter

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/build.yml` - Fixed FreeBSD shell, added Windows build
- `README` - Updated platform support, recent improvements
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Added recent fixes section
- `STATUS.md` - New quick status file
- `docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md` - Moved from root

## Testing

After these changes, all three CI builds should pass:
- ✅ Linux (Ubuntu) - Already working
- ✅ FreeBSD - Fixed by removing bash dependency
- ✅ Windows (MSYS2) - Newly added

## Commit Message

```
fix(ci): Remove bash dependency in FreeBSD build, add Windows CI

- Remove `usesh: true` from FreeBSD workflow (bash not available by default)
- Add Windows build using MSYS2/MinGW-w64
- Update README and PROJECT_STATUS.md with recent improvements
- Create STATUS.md for quick status overview
- Move CURRENT_STATUS.md to docs/ directory

Fixes FreeBSD CI failures caused by hardcoded /usr/bin/bash path.
```
