## ❌ Known Issues

### Critical: Preferences Dialog Crashes
**Status:** NEEDS FIX  
**Symptom:** Clicking Edit → Preferences causes crash (coredump)  
**Impact:** Cannot access preferences

**Likely Cause:** Same as File Open - wrong callback signature for GAction

### PDF Opening Not Tested
**Status:** Need test file  
**Symptom:** No PDF available on test machine  
**Impact:** Cannot verify PDF viewing works

### Command Line File Opening
**Status:** Not tested  
**Symptom:** Passing PDF on command line not tested  
**Impact:** Unknown if works

## 🔧 Critical Bugs Fixed This Session

### Bug #1: Window Never Appeared
**Problem:** App ran but window invisible, exited immediately

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Added `appData->mainView->show()` call in `on_activate()`
2. Registered window with GtkApplication via `gtk_application_add_window()`
3. Changed `gtk_widget_show()` to `gtk_window_present()`
4. Added window size validation for WSLg

**Files:** `main.cxx`, `MainView.cxx`, `MainView.h`

### Bug #2: Invalid Screen Size in WSLg
**Problem:** WSLg reported "131072x1 screen size is bogus"

**Fix:** Added sanity checks, use 800x600 default for invalid sizes

**File:** `MainView.cxx:746-751`

### Bug #3: GApplication Configuration
**Problem:** App claimed to handle file opening but didn't implement it

**Fix:** Changed from `G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN` to `G_APPLICATION_FLAGS_NONE`

**File:** `main.cxx:161`

### Bug #4: File Open Callback Signature Mismatch
**Problem:** File → Open menu crashed with "data parameter is NULL" assertion

**Root Cause:** GAction callbacks have different signature than GtkWidget callbacks:
- GAction: `void callback(GSimpleAction*, GVariant*, gpointer)`
- Widget: `void callback(GtkWidget*, gpointer)`

**Fix:** Created separate `main_window_open_file_action_cb()` with correct GAction signature

**Files:** `MainView.cxx:66, 99, 1586-1592`

**Result:** File → Open now works! Dialog opens without crash.

## 📋 Testing Checklist

### Completed ✅
- [x] Application compiles
- [x] Application starts
- [x] Window appears
- [x] Window is responsive
- [x] Menus display
- [x] Can exit application (Ctrl+Q, File → Quit)
- [x] File → Open dialog opens

### Blocked by Preferences Crash ❌
- [ ] Preferences dialog (crashes)

### Blocked by Lack of Test PDF ⚠️
- [ ] Open PDF file (need test file)
- [ ] Navigate pages (need PDF)
- [ ] Zoom functions (need PDF)
- [ ] Find text (need PDF)
- [ ] Print (need PDF)
- [ ] All other features (need PDF)

### Not Yet Tested ⚠️
- All features require opening a PDF first

## 🚀 How to Run

### WSL (Windows 11 with WSLg)
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
/usr/local/bin/epdfview
```

### Native Arch Linux
```bash
epdfview
```

### Expected Warnings (Safe to Ignore)
```
libEGL warning: DRI3 error
Gtk-WARNING: Unable to acquire session bus
your 131072x1 screen size is bogus (now handled)
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Immediate (Critical)
1. **Debug file open dialog crash**
   - Run with gdb when opening file
   - Check MainView::openFileDialog() implementation
   - Verify GtkFileChooserDialog GTK4 compatibility

2. **Test PDF opening**
   - Create minimal test PDF
   - Try opening from GUI
   - Try opening from command line

### Short Term
3. Test all menu items
4. Test all toolbar buttons
5. Verify keyboard shortcuts
6. Test PDF navigation
7. Test zoom functions

### Medium Term
8. Test print functionality
9. Test find/search
10. Test preferences dialog
11. Test all 22 translations

## 💡 Development Notes

### GTK4 Patterns Used
- `gtk_application_add_window()` for window registration
- `gtk_window_present()` instead of `gtk_widget_show()`
- GMainLoop pattern for modal dialogs
- Event controllers for input handling
- GMenuModel for menu system

### Common Pitfalls Avoided
- Window not registered → app exits immediately
- gtk_widget_show() insufficient for windows
- Invalid screen sizes in WSL
- GApplication flags mismatch

---

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### If Window Doesn't Show
```bash
export G_MESSAGES_DEBUG=all
export DISPLAY=:0
epdfview 2>&1 | tee epdfview.log
```

### If Crashes
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
gdb -ex 'run' -ex 'bt' --args /usr/local/bin/epdfview
```

### Check Process
```bash
export DISPLAY=:0
epdfview &
ps aux | grep epdfview
```
